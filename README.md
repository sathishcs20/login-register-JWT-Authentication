It is a login form where users can register using their mail id and password.Validated users input and displayed error message in register form.Once they successfully registered mail will be sent to the registered mail using send grid API and mail id and hashed password is saved in database.when user login with correct credentials this directs them to their profile page and jwt web token is created for that particular user,there they can update their profile picture.I have used multer library to handle files.I have used middleware which restricts the user to view profile page without login.
